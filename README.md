# Mobile-Wikipedia-Redirect
A simple Safari extension to re-direct desktop Wikipedia to mobile Wikipedia for greater readability. This version causes strange behavior in the Address bar when editing Wikipedia urls or auto-completing Wikipedia urls, but redirects immediately to mobile Wikipedia instead of first loading desktop Wikipedia. 

Currently only works with English Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org).
